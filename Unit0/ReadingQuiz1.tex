\item Lieutenant James Clark Ross was a naval officer who was ordered by the Admiralty to complete a ``magnetic survey'' of Earth's southern lattitudes.  When he learned that American and French explorers could reach the \textit{magnetic} South Pole first, he decided to instead explore uncharted Antarctic waters.
