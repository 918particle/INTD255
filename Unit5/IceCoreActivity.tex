\section{Plotting the Data}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Navigate your desktop PC or laptop to the course Moodle page, and scroll to the bottom.
\item Download the two Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx format) entitled DronningMaudLand and SouthPole.  These are data corresponding to the Paleoclimatology Data Map we explored.
\item Manipulate the data to get the gas age in years before present (AD) from the South Pole data set next to the mean CO2 level in parts per million by volume.
\item Plot the data in an x-y scatter plot.  Do you observe an increase in greenhouse gas concentration?
\item Repeat the exercise from the data from Dronning Maud Land (DML), and add the data to the plot.
\item Do the data agree for the years since the middle ages? Why or why not?
\item What do we observe in more recent years?  Draw the graph below and highlight the area corresponding to CO2 increases. \\ \vspace{4cm}
\item If there is time, repeat the entire exercise but add \textit{error bars} from the final column in each data set.
\end{enumerate}
